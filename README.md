# Team:  Are You in the Right Neighborhood?

### Team Members:  Ruby Mittal, Philip Wirth, Jeff Eickholt

#### Summary:  We used data from the City of Houston 311 sytem.  This is a system where citizens of Houston can submit question or report issues, such as a missed garbage pickup.  The date is logged when the issue is reported and a due date is assigned.  The date when the issue is closed is logged when resolved.  We wanted to see if socioeconomic factors or weather would affect whether the issues are closed by the due date or not.
